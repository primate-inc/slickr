# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  updated_at: <%= DateTime.now %>
  created_at: <%= DateTime.now %>

two:
  updated_at: <%= DateTime.now %>
  created_at: <%= DateTime.now %>
